Section 301

For my use of AI this week, I was really bored one night and told ChatGPT to predict the next games for the 
Baltimore Ravens (win or lose) for the rest of the season. Surprisingly, it says that the
Ravens were going to win for the upcoming game against the Cheifs. Personally, with how our team is performing so
far, I think it's highly unlikely that we'll win this game. However, AI only gave me a prediction, so it's not like 
I can rely on it. Anything can happen during football games.

Regarding this course, I used AI to double-check my understanding as well as gaining more practice. Like I said in
the previous journals, I'm still a little rough with my python skills since it's been a while. More specifically, 
def functions and using booleans in them. Doing a case sensitive search is something I don't recall learnning before,
so I told the tool to give mt a few examples. This served as a little guide while doing this weeks exercises.
