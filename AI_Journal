Week 1

This week I used AI to help regain my knowledge of python. It's been a while since I last touched this langauge so some basic concepts are a little blurry to me.
But after doing some practice, things started to feel familar again. I asked AI to provide examples of boolean expressions and string slicing since I forgot
how it works. Here's a link to the convo: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c7746f-d748-800f-9011-108b27617c06 
I did not use AI to do the exercises nor did I use for debugging. I simply used it to get a grasp of how they are used and the different way to code them, which I
thought was helpful as a guide.

I also used AI for one of my Journalism assignments. We were told told to ask it for detailed information about a process while giving it specifc details to work off of.
You can see my conversation as an example: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c77898-aad8-800f-9b0d-7cb3e3d25aaf
I was then prompted to ask the same exact thing a second time to see if theres any differnce. This shows how AI can turn very specifc intructions and translate them 
into answers that are creative. AI also has the ability to adjust and refining the prompt can lead to more specialized results.
