Section 301

This week I used AI to break down on how abstract properties can change a class design
and ask it to provide examples. This is so that I can understand the structure in order to 
not get lost in the code. I also asked it to show the different ways to design methods that
allows subclasses to follow the same output pattern. This helped me think about making
cleaner/consistent designs. The link below is the conversation, I did not use Ai to debug
or help assist with this weeks exercise.
