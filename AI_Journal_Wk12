Section 301

This week I didn't use AI for anything regarding academics. Kind of similar to what I mentioned
in previous journals that I used the tool for personal use. I was shopping on this app called Lewkin,
a clothing company in Korea. As you browse through a piece of clothing, and read the reviews, it will
use AI to summarize what the people are saying about the purchase. With this feature, this allowed me
to get a better understanding of the general reviews without having to scroll through every single one.
I found it really helpful and saved me a lot of time because it mentioned common points like whether the
material is cheap or if the sizing runs too small or too big. I think that most shopping websites that
have a review system should offer an AI review summarizer. This would make shopping a little bit more
effecient.
