This week I  chatted with AI for @property and @setter examples. I wanted to undertand how they
are used in classes, more specifically for validating data. AI then gave me a few examples, including 
ones where it raises errors when bad data is entered. This really helped me see how to apply it in real
projects. I more so used this AI tool as a GUIDE for these exercises, I did not use it for debugging or 
to complete the exercises.

Outside of this class, I used AI on Amazon to help me shop for home decor. Pretty much the same process
as I stated last week where I used their feature on summary product reviews. This makes me save time
on reading every single review, and I don't find myself not reading them everytime I shop.
