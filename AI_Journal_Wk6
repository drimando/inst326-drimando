Section 301

This week I used AI to help me clarify how class methods work. I asked it
to provide me examples of when to use @classmethod instead of regualar method, 
how cls works inside a class method, etc. (see link to see the convo). 
Like I said in previous weeks, this helps me understand more clearly since I'm
unfamiliar and see how I can apply them with practice/future projects.

I did not use AI to complete any of the exercise questions. It was just to serve
as a small guide to enhance my understanding.
