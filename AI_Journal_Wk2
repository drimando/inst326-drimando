This week I used AI to guide me on how to use some of the methods when writing code. For example, append and reverse. It's been a while since I last used those
and I wanted to regain my knowledge about them. Also, I had some trouble trying to figure out how find indexes, especially when writing the format of it, so I 
asked it to give me some examples. Heres the link of the conversation:

The other day, I discovered Spotify's new AI feature called DJ. I'm actually not too sure if it's new, but it was my first time seeing it pop up in the app for me. 
It's a personalized radio DJ that compiles songs tailored to your music taste/preferences while recommending new songs. There's an AI voice in between songs that 
talks like a radio person would. It explains why that song was chosen and gives background information about the artist. I actually enjoyed it, but it wouldn't be
something I would use on a regular, only because I created multiple playlists on my own, each having a certain vibe.
