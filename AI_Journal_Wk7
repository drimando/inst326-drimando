This week I used AI to help me organize a cheat sheet for me for my stats midterm. I told it to give definitions
and write my down key formulas that we have been using throughout the semester. I also gave it an example problem 
from one of our textbooks and help me step by step solve it. First I did it on my own then see what the AI tool
said after. Most of the time I used past notes, but this was just to serve me a guide.
