This week I didn't use AI for anything academic. But recently I was on Amazon shopping for toiletries and beauty products
and came across the reviews. I saw at the very top of the page, there's an AI summary of the customer reviews. It gathers the
most recent reviews and generates them into a small paragraph, highlighting the constant themes mentioned about the product.
I think this is a really cool feature to have because it saves time trying to scroll through each review. This can also help
filter out any bias or irrelevant information people have said, or people trying to make manipulative reviews.
